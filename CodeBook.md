#Code Book
All 5 steps that were specified in the project description can be found in run_analysis.R.  

Within the file, similar data from the many files provided is merged.  
Once all data have been combined, we take the data that correlate with mean and standard deviation and are reorganized by name of column. 
After combining the data sets, the names are not correct, so in step 3 we replace the names from the feature.txt provided from the zip file.
We then provide more specific column names to the data set.
In the end, we output a new text file with a data set that contains the averages of all data.
